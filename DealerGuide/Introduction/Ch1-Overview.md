### The Game
_Draw Your Weapon_ (shortened to _DYW_ for the remainder of this booklet) is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game where a group of players come together to tell a story through shared fantasy.

### Your Role
As the Dealer you act as a conductor for the Players. You control the world beyond the Player Characters, including the Non-Player Characters, environments, and story events. By acting both as the party's allies and enemies you help to drive the narrative by providing conflict. You should challenge the party wihtout overwhelming them and help to create an engaging story to play through.  
You are the ruling authority of the game, when rules are unclear or go against the story your party wishes to tell you can and should overrules them at your discression. However, you should always remember that your job is not to defeat the party, it is to create an enjoyable experience.
