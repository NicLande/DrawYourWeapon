## Getting Started
In *Draw Your Weapon* you and your friends take on the role of a group of conniving wanderers within The Frontier. A place where the organized ravenous greed of colonialist expansion meets the wilds of an unforgiving magical land to the west. Your group must strive to survive and do good where you can while the world around you is ever changing. Will you join the ever expanding corporations in their goals to understand and tame The Frontier in search of resources and wealth? Or will you seek to join the resistance, and fight to free The Frontier of human intervention? Perhaps you and your friends will strike out on your own, in search of a third path. Whatever your goals are, you will need all the wits, strength, and magic you can muster to survive. The Frontier isn't a place where just anyone can make it.

## What Is Draw Your Weapon?
*Draw Your Weapon* is a fantasy-western tabletop roleplaying game focused on tense action and the endless possibilities of a magical world. The game is played by creating a shared story of make believe with a group for friends. *Draw Your Weapon* alternates between narration from the dealer, who controls and plays as the world, and the players, who each control and play as an individual character of their own creation.
