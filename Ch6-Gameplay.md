## Narrative Time

## Conflict
When the narrative of a game reaches a climax where the players and the world around them are at a crossroads a conflict may break out. Within The Frontier conflicts of all kinds are quick and brutal affairs and come in all shapes and sizes. Draw Your Weapon has two systems for handling these conflicts, **firefights** and **negotiations**.

### Firefight
These conflicts are represntations of tensions boiling over into violence, an all too common occurence in The Frontier. Firefights are not minor affairs, small brawls or individual attacks can be handled in narrative time without resorting to a firefight. When two sides stand against one another, metaphorically or otheriwise, with guns at the ready and their breath caught in their throat from the tension a firefight is called for. Firefights happen in three steps: the standoff, the draw, and the aftermath. In each of these phases the players and the dealer select an action to take in secret, then play cards in order to determine the order and success of those actions.

#### Standoff 
The beginning of a firefight is a moment of tension where each side has yet to truly begin the fight. The actions taken here set you up for the main attacks and defences during the following steps. Most characters will have special actions which only they may take, but the following actions are available to all characters.

**Taunt:** Brag to your opponent and the crowd. Social check (Ante based on Dealer discussion). Gain clout based on num of people there. Attacks against you during Draw deals damage to both health and clout. You become Vulnerable

**Call Shot:** Declare where on your opponent youâ€™ll hit. Spend the corresponding amount of Ante. If you successfully attack them during the Draw or Firefight step the following modifier is applied to the attack:  
  _Head:_ your target counts as vulnerable  
  _Arm:_   
  _Leg:_  
  _Hand:_ your target drops whatever they are holding in that hand. This attack deals no damage.  
  _Chest:_ your target becomes Prone  

**Reposition:** You may move up to your speed. If cover is available you can move behind it

**Read Opponent:** skill test ante determined by Dealer. Success you get to see their next action before you make your own. Failure nothing happens

#### Draw
As the namesake of this step implies, this is the moment where all characters can draw their weapons. If your character has a weapon or tool needed for any of their actions, it is automatically assumed to be available from this point of combat forward. The following actions are available to all characters during the draw step.

**Fire:** make an attack with your weapon at a valid target within range.

**Dive:** move to cover. Become Prone


**Charge:** Run at an enemy within range.

**Cover:** Place yourself between a target and danger. They gain Cover, and all attacks this round targeted at them target you instead.

**Reposition:** move up to your speed.

**Flee:** Attempt to run away. 

**Use Gear:** Use any piece of equipment or a key item you have.

#### Aftermath
In the moments after bullets fly and spells sling the injured are left with a moment to breathe and the bold a moment to follow up. During the aftermath you may take any of the actions from the previous steps in addition to the following:

**Recover:** Clear one status effect from yourself

**Reload:** Expend one reserve to replenish your weapon's ammunition

### Negotiations
