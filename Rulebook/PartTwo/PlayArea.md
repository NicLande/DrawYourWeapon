## Chapter 4: Play Area
---
When playing Draw Your Weapon it is important to understand and properly set up the table or space which your group is playing on. You will need space for various Card sources to remain on or to move throughout the play area for the duration. This chapter outlines each location a Card can be in and how that collection operates.

## The Library
The Library represents destiny. As Cards are Drawn from The Library the Party falls further into exhaustion and desperation. When it empties the tide of the story turns against the Party. Balancing the power of the Cards and the cost of draining The Library is essential to any Party’s success.
The Library is the default home of all Cards. It is shuffled and remains facedown throughout play. Generally, all Cards are Drawn from the top of the Library. At the start of each session, unless otherwise stated by the rules or Dealer, all of the Cards begin in The Library. To create the Library shuffle two standard decks of playing cards together, with the Jokers included.

## Your Hand
Each Player’s hand represents their characters immediate reserves and resources. For mages it is indicative of their current magical power, for warriors it represents their raw power and stamina, and for scoundrels it may represent the dirty tricks and schemes they have up their sleeve. As a Player’s hand fills and empties so too do their options grow more diverse and desperate.
A Player’s Hand is where Cards are Drawn to and are usually Played from. A Player may choose to reveal cards from their hand or keep them private, even choosing to reveal cards only to specific Players. All Players have a maximum hand size determined by their character’s stats and abilities. A Hand may not have more Cards in it than its maximum size. If a Hand exceeds its maximum size the Player must immediately discard the excess Cards into The Void before any other effects occur.

## The Pile
The Pile represents the current situation and environment the Party is in. As the situation grows more complex and the tides of situations turn for and against the party the Pile will change to reflect it.
The Pile is publicly visible to all Players and the Dealer. At the start of each session the Pile is empty.
It is filled when Players or the Dealer play Cards. Whenever a Card is Played it is placed onto the top of the Pile face up. Whatever Card is showing on the top of the Pile is the Top Card, and may impact Player or NPC Abilities. Players and the Dealer may look through The Pile at any time to inspect what Cards are within, but they may not change the order of the Cards unless an Ability states otherwise.

## The Void
As Cards are Discarded they feed The Void. The Void is a representation of dark magic and ambient negative energy. The Void is the fear in your gut as you face a dragon. The Void is the clouds that obscure the sun in a storm. The Void is the encroaching darkness as the night sky devours the day.
When Cards are Discarded they enter The Void, regardless of whether they were discarded by the Dealer or a Player. Cards in The Void are face up and their order does not matter. Players and the Dealer may look through The Void at any time and may change the order of the Cards at will.
