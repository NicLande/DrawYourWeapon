## Chapter 7: Turn Order
---

## Start of Combat
When physical conflict breaks out between the party and some outside force Combat begins. In order for combat to run smoothly several steps must be taken in order to facilitate a smooth and fun experience for the Players and Dealer.

### Determine Surprise
Firstly, the Dealer must determine which creatures, if any, were caught off guard by the start of the conflict. Most often this will be done through the Dealer using the results of a Test from just before combat or a Test specifically at the moment combat begins. Regardless of the method used, once the Dealer determines who was and was not surprised each Player can begin preparing for the battle.

**Surprised:** If you begin combat surprised you begin combat by setting your Current Guard to half of your Maximum Guard and your Speed you 0.

**Not Surprised:** If you do not begin combat surprised, you begin by setting your Current Guard to your Maximum Guard, drawing any weapons, shields, or other wieldable items you wish, and setting your Speed to your maximum Speed.

### Map
DYW will ideally be played in a situation where your playgroup can represent the battlefield with a battlemap. A piece of paper, dry erase mat, or surface to draw on with 1” squares can be used to accurately measure distances for abilities. In the case where you have a map like this each square represents 1 unit. After determining surprise your Dealer should set up the battlemap, placing terrain, creatures, and other environmental factors as they exist in game.

### Initiative Tracker
Along with a battlemap it is recommended that your Dealer prepares a fast way to track the Initiative of your group. The simplest method for this is to select some kind of easily distinguishable token for the Players and NPCs such as poker chips or dice and place them in the order of Initiative.

## Initiative
The combat of DYW is turn based and relies on Rounds and Turns. A Round is a collection of Turns, taking just a few short moments within the game to execute. A Turn is each creature’s chance to act in combat taking Actions and Moving as needed. 

### Determining Initiative
At the beginning of each Round every combatant must determine their place in Initiative. You determine this by adding together the Value of the highest Spades Card in your Hand to your Current Speed. If you do not have any Spade Cards in your Hand you instead just use your Current Speed.
In the event of an initiative tie with another creature, Players always win over NPCs and Players decide amongst themselves who goes first when Initiative is determined.

## Your Turn
Your Turn in combat is your chance to affect the battlefield through Attacks, the use of Features, and Movement. On your turn you can take two Actions and Move. Only one of those Actions can be an Attack.

### Movement
On your turn you can use your Speed to move and take small actions. In order to move any character may use 1 Speed per Unit moved. You may also use 1 Speed to take small actions such as drawing or stowing a weapon, interacting with an object such as a button or lever, or taking some extra form of movement such as a jump. You can move before, between, or after taking Actions and can break your movement up into however many steps you wish. This is separate from the Combat Move Action.

### Actions
The main function of your turn is to take Actions. You can take a number of Actions on your turn as described in Chapter 5. The Actions you can take are reiterated here with a brief description.

**Tests:** When you take certain Actions the Dealer will call for a Test in place of allowing the Action to simply happen.

**Attacks:** There are a variety of types of Attacks you can take. You may only make one Attack per turn unless otherwise noted.

**Combat Move:** Refreshes your Speed to its Maximum.

**Defend:** You gain immunity to Surprise Tests and may increase your Current Guard by your Guard Refresh. If you have the Broken Condition you instead remove the Broken Condition.

**Use Ability:** You may use any Feature which states you may use it as an Action.
