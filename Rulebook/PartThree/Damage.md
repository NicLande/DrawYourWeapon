## Chapter 9: Damage
--- 

There are a multitude of ways within DYW to take damage. Damage is a representation of the injuries and harm being inflicted onto a creature. However, damage does not always land properly when inflicted. Whenever you or another creature take damage there are several chances to decrease or remove it before it affects you. After applying changes from each of the following values you reduce your Current HP by the damage being dealt to you.

## Defenses
When you take damage, before you apply it to your HP you must check your defenses to see if you can reduce it in any way.

**Immunity:** If you have an Immunity to any of the tags the source of the damage has you take no damage from that source. In addition you ignore all non-damage effects from Features with tags you have an Immunity to.

**Resistance:** If you have a Resistance to any tags the source of the damage has you reduce the damage by your Resistances Value. If you have multiple applicable Resistances you may only apply one.

**Guard:** If you take damage from an Attack you take the damage to your Current Guard rather than your Current HP. If there is any damage remaining when your Current Guard reaches 0 that remainder is applied as normal to your Current HP. When your Current Guard reaches 0 this way you gain the Broken Condition.

## Dying
When you fall to 0 Current HP you cannot go any lower. You are at the brink of death and thus gain the Dying Condition. When Dying you Discard one Card at random at the start of each of your turns until you run out of Cards and die. A character dying is a major event in the story. Speak with your Dealer and the other Players about how you wish for your death to be handled in the story and the game. You may choose to make a new character and have them join the party. Perhaps your party will go on a quest to attempt to bring you back from the dead. DYW is a game of fantastical adventures, so death may not be the end, but for some play groups the threat of death helps to set stakes for the game.

> Option rule - Incapacitation: Your Dealer may opt to use the Incapacitation optional rule in place of having characters die. With this rule set in place death is replaced with a brief coma-like state. Your character is not dead but cannot awaken, take damage, or use Features. You recover as normal the next time your party Rests.
