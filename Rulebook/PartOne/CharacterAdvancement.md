## Character Advancement

## Experience
As your character embarks on their adventure they will gain more and more power and knowledge. This experience of growing and changing as you embark on your hero’s journey is represented in _DYW_ through an accumulation and expenditure of Experience. You should already have some experience yourself with the function of Experience through character creation. Much like when you created your character you may spend Experience to gain new Features or increase your Attributes. In addition, as you spend more and more Experience you will increase your character’s Level and become broadly stronger.

### Gaining Experience
There are five ways to gain Experience in _DYW_. The first of these is the most based in reality. Every time you fail a Skill Test you gain one Experience. As your character realizes how they are flawed they can begin to grow and change to address those flaws.  
The second method draws inspiration from many other great tabletop roleplaying systems. At the end of each Combat you will be rewarded both in game and through mechanical rewards. For many monsters this means gaining Experience, though it is not always the case and may come with conditions.  
The third method rewards players who demonstrate exceptional roleplay for the benefit of the overall story. At the end of each session, the party democratically selects the player who best demonstrated the Style/Relationships of their character, awarding them one point of Experience.  
The fourth method to gain Experience is through a Cataclysm. These events are described in greater detail in Chapter 6, but are relevant here as well. Whenever a Cataclysm occurs every Player receives one Experience.  
The final method for gaining Experience is the most straightforward. The Dealer may award Experience at their discretion for anything they feel warrants the reward which is not covered in the above methods.  

### Spending Experience
After you’ve gone through the trouble of gaining some Experience you will likely be eager to spend it. However, you cannot spend Experience at will. When your playgroup forms and you begin to play _DYW_ your Dealer will select what conditions must be met before you may spend Experience. This may be selected based on group discussion or vote, but the Dealer holds final word on what the conditions are. Here are three common examples of conditions needed to spend Experience. Dealers may require multiple of these or make them interchangeable.  </br></br> 
**Reaching a Threshold:** Whenever you reach a certain amount of Experience you must spend all of it at once. Oftentimes the threshold is 5 or 10, in order to line up with the gaining of Levels.  
**Resting:** With this condition the only requirement for you to spend Experience is to take the Rest action in game. Occasionally Dealers may only allow you to make one Experience purchase per Rest.  
**End of Session:** Dealers may require you to make all of your Experience purchases outside of regular gameplay, so as to keep sessions quickly paced.  
**Downtime:** To preserve a certain in-game pacing Dealers may have Players spend multiple in-game days or weeks in order to properly gain and integrate the skills they gain. </br></br>
When spending Experience you do so exactly as you would during character creation. You may further upgrade your Attributes or purchase Features for their Cost. The Amount of Experience required for an Attribute is equivalent to the value you are purchasing and you must purchase each level individually. To purchase a Feature you must spend an amount of Experience equal to that Feature's costs and meet all of the Feature’s prerequisites.





## Leveling Up
Once you have gained a certain amount of Experience on your journey you will begin to grow stronger overall, rather than just in your niche strengths. This overall measure of your ability is referred to as your Level and is an abstraction of your general power level within the world.

### Your Level
Your Level is defined as 1+(Total Experience Gained/10). This calculation looks at all of the Experience you have gained in your adventures and does not go down if you spend the Experience. Your level is not important often on its own, but is often relevant for prerequisites and the abilities of others.

### Gaining Levels
Each time you gain a Level several of your Stats increase. Your Guard, HP, Reserve, and Clout are all intrinsically tied to your Level. Each Level you gain automatically adds another instance of the tied Attribute to their total. In addition, each of your Stats has a value in their calculation referred to as their Level Bonus. This value begins at 0 but may be increased when you gain a Level. Whenever you gain a Level you select one of your Stats and increase the associated Level Bonus by 1. For HP, Speed, Max Hand Size, Reserve, and Clout this increases their maximum by 1. For Guard this increases your Guard Refresh by 1.

### Maximum Level
Once you have gained 130 Experience you will have reached Level 14. This is the highest level _DYW_ is built for. Once you have reached this point you no longer gain Experience as you have reached the peak of what you are capable of as a mortal. Your Dealer may bend these rules or provide alternative forms of advancement, however this is the assumed peak of power in most games of _DYW_.
