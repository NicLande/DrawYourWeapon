## Chapter 1: Overview
---
_Draw Your Weapon_ (shortened to _DYW_ for the remainder of this booklet) is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game focused on high flying action and the endless possibilities of a magical world. The game is played by creating a shared story of make believe with a group for friends. _DYW_ alternates between narration from the Dealer, who controls and plays as the world, and the Players, who each control and play as an individual character of their own creation. This booklet, the Player Guide, will focus on the game from the perspective of a player. For a breakdown of the rules as a Dealer please read the Dealer Manual. A game of _Draw Your Weapon_ can last for a single session, much like a regular board game, or as a longer campaign spanning weeks, months, or even years.


### The Players
As a Player in _Draw Your Weapon_ you will create a character to play as for the duration of the game. The characters Players create are appropriately known as Player Characters and will have traits, abilities, and stats which define what they can do within the game. These features are based on various other fantasy games and media and are intended to help you construct a character you will be able to tell a dynamic and interesting story with. Should you wish to create a great knight, a stealthy rogue, or a crazed mage the character creation process will allow you to fulfill that fantasy in the game. All together, these Player Characters form a single Party to experience the game world with.


### The Dealer
While the Players each control a single character of their creation the Dealer creates and controls everything else in the game. Characters beyond the Player Characters, known as Non-Player Characters or NPCs occupy the world. The weather, politics, and monsters that make the world a dynamic living place are all controlled by the Dealer.   
The Dealer is also a player of the game, and their enjoyment is important. However, for the sake of clarity they will be referred to exclusively as the Dealer and any text referring to Players does not include them.  
The Dealer’s primary responsibility is to narrate scenes for the Players, which they can react to and act accordingly. Additionally, the Dealer manages the mechanics of the world outside of the Players.

### The Game
 _Draw Your Weapon_  is both a storytelling system and a game to be played with friends. By properly marrying these two aspects of the system your playgroup can fully experience the joy of  _Draw Your Weapon_ . The gameplay of _Draw Your Weapon_ is primarily expressed through two decks of standard playing Cards shuffled together into The Library. The Players and Dealer share these decks of Cards which they use to fill their hands, and they use the cards in their hands to interact with the world of the game. However, the Dealer’s hand controls multiple characters and the world around the players, rather than just one character. By balancing their Hands, the Library, and the various other card states in the game the Players and Dealer can cooperate to tell an immersive and captivating story, all while having fun.

 ### What You’ll Need
In order to play _DYW_ not much is needed. At minimum you will need two people, one to fill the role of the Dealer and one to fill the role of a Player. While only two are necessary, it is recommended that you have between four to six friends in your group, including the Dealer. In addition to friends, a group will need two decks of cards, paper, and pencils. At a minimum that is all that is needed to play  _Draw Your Weapon_ . However, should you wish to improve your ease of play it is recommended that you track your Player Characters using the official _DYW_ character sheets, and keep at least one Cheat Sheet on hand to reference common rules and game mechanics.

### Setting Up
At the beginning of each session of play begin by shuffling two standard decks of playing cards together to create the Library. Then, deal 5 Cards to each Player. The Dealer will draw one card for each Player in the session. Create enough space so that everyone at the table can easily reach for two additional stacks of Cards. These stacks will be referred to as the Pile and Void. Lastly, if a Cataclysm did not occur in the previous session of play look at the top Card of the Library and Play that many Cards directly from the top of the Library. Repeat this for each sequential session previous to the current session which did not have a Cataclysm. Ignore this step if this is your first session of play in a campaign.

### Breaking Down
At the end of a session the Pile, Void, and all Hands are shuffled back into the Library.  Mark down whether or not a Cataclysm occurred this session. Finally, democratically select one Player to receive one Experience.

### The Story
While the rules and mechanics which control the game are an important aspect of _DYW_ it is equally important for everyone involved to accept and embrace the storytelling aspect of the system. The goal of this game is not to win, but rather to weave a satisfying tale of action, comedy, drama, and incredible spectacle. If the rules of the game ever interfere with that goal, they should be modified or dropped in order to suit your play group. This is referred to as Rule 0.

### Example of Play
To aid your understanding of how the game works moment to moment, here is an example of a scene of play.</br></br>
>**Nicolas (Dealer):** As you journey northwards toward the capital your cart driver suddenly halts the movement of your wagon. He signals to you through the flap to exit the wagon.  <br/></br>
**Morgan (Player):** Do I notice anything immediately dangerous?  <br/></br>
**Nicolas (Dealer):** No, everything seems normal from inside.  <br/></br>
**Zach (Player):** Ok, in that case I’ll exit the cart and see why we stopped.  
**Morgan (Player):** I’ll follow but stay on guard.  <br/></br>
**Nicolas (Dealer):** Are you using the Guard action? Remember that will keep you from doing much unless you drop your guard.  <br/></br>
**Morgan (Player):** Sure, I’ll take the action. I’d rather be safe in case there’s a trap.  <br/></br>
**Nicolas (Dealer):** Ok, the two of you exit the wagon and before the driver even has a chance to speak you see the problem. Ahead of you on the trail is a massive stone bridge, likely built by the empire based on the imperial sigils adorning the front. To your shock the middle of this massive structure has collapsed into the riverbed below. Your only way forward has become near impossible to pass.  <br/></br>
**Zach (Player):** I walk up to inspect the bridge, can I tell what caused it to collapse? I’ll do an Interaction if I have to.   <br/></br>
**Nicolas (Dealer):** Yeah, go ahead and play a  card for the Interaction. You’re trying to investigate something so we’ll say if you play a Diamonds card you can add your Intelligence score.  <br/></br>
**Zach (Player):** Ok, I’ll play my 8 of Diamonds and my intelligence is 2 so that’s a total of 10.  <br/></br>
**Nicolas (Dealer):** That’s enough to pass! As you approach the collapsed section of the bridge you can see something odd about the break. It seems more like this was destroyed with some kind of explosion rather than erosion or natural causes.  <br/></br>
**Zach (Player):** Ok, I announce to my party and the driver “stay on guard! This was no accident. We need to find another way across.”  <br/></br>
**Nicolas (Dealer):** With everyone working together to heed your warning you begin the trek to find an alternate route.

### The World
_DYW_ takes place in the high fantasy world of Viatus, a land where nature and civilization mix, blend, and clash. Viatus is the name of both the world and pangeatic continent which _DYW_ is set within. This world is populated by many disparrate city-states governed by houses in a pseudo feudalistic system. Outside of the bounds of civilization magic and elementals reign suppreme. The people who venture into these arcane wilds in search of resources, treasure, and glory are adventurers. While not all game of _DYW_ will focus on a party of adventurers the world is moved greatly by their actions and it is the assumed default option for a party.

#### Houses and City-States
Unlike most fantasy worlds Viatus is not filled with kingdoms and empires as our own history is. The vast majority of governance is handled by houses and city-states.   
A city-state is any city large enough to also control to land around it and sustains itself with the territory it holds.  
A house is an organization which shares characteristics with guilds and noble houses. Houses are made up of a large number of members with a shared quality, often a skill, trade, or ambition. As a member of a house a person gains access to resources and rights given by that house, akin in our world to having citizenship to a country. Membership to a house can be lost or gained in a variety of ways. For instance one could gain access to an academic house with access to a university by applying with an essay and being accepted. Most people are born with at least one house membership based upon their parentage and where they live.
Houses and City-States are symbiotic. Most city-states are governed by a house leader or council of house leaders. While some houses have multiple locations of operation, most exist only within a single city-state and are sustained by it, granting membership to all who live in the city-state, or the part that house controls in cities with multiple houses. Houses themselves can be run democratically or through other systems such as a meritocract or autocracy.

#### Magic and Elementals
All magic within the world of Viatus is tied to the elements. Th five basic elements in this world are Earth, Sea, Sky, Sun, and Void. These elements can be mixed and remixed to form sub elements, and they each individually contain many aspects.

**Earth:** The element of rock, nature, and dust.
**Sea:** The element of water, liquid, and change.
**Sky:** The element of air, movement, and flight.
**Sun:** The element of fire, light, and energy.
**Void:** The element of darkness, emptiness, and deception.

These magical aspects of the world interact with Viatus through elementals. Elementals are creatures from another realm without form that are attracted to phenomena in Viatus attuned to their nature. A Sun Elemental will often be attracted to fire, a Sea Elemental may be attracted to  crashing wave, and a Void Elemental may be attracted to the darnkess of a new moon.  
When human mages cast spells or use magical features they are calling on the power of elementals from the other side to aid them. Monsters and magical phenomena within the physical realm are the result of an elemental moving to the other side of the veil and possessing someone or something, imbuing it with power. This process and its effects are covered in greater detail in the Dealer's Guide.


#### The Wilds
Elementals and the magic they bring aren't often found in civilization. Outside of the borders of the city states and their houses are The Wilds. These areas are abound with magic far more than the towns and cities most people are born and raised in. Within the wilds lie a multitude of creatures both peaceful and dangerous, but all bearing power granted by the elementals. Great artifacts and resources can be harvested by journeying out into The Wilds and risking death.
