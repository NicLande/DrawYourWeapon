# Character Creation

## Character Creation Steps

### Step 1: Create a Character Concept
**Overall Concept:** The first step to creating your character is deciding on an overall concept. This concept will define what choices you make going through the process. Perhaps you wish to master the blade and focus on making choices which enhance your ability to wield bladed weapons. Maybe you want to play a mage who commands the very elements themselves. It may even be that you wish to play a character who avoids combat in favor of supporting the rest of the party through social skills or medicine. Regardless of your choice, communicate with the others at the table to ensure that you are creating a well rounded and dynamic party. 

**Name:** In addition to an overall concept which defines your character you will need to name the person you play as. The name of a character is not important for their abilities and features, however it can help define and communicate their personality. When you have decided upon a name write it down in the name section of the character sheet.

**Appearance:** Similarly to their name, a character's appearance has no bearing on their abilities. However, you and the rest of the party should be aware of the basic appearance of the characters you are playing with, as it may affect the story. If you are artistically inclined you may draw some notable aspects of your character on the figure on the character sheet.

### Step 2: Choose an Archetype
Once you have begun to gain an undertstanding of who your character is you can apply an Archetype to them. *Draw Your Weapon* has 12 archetypes to choose from, each detailed in chapter 2 of this rulebook. Your archetype grants you certain abilties which allow you to both manipulate the cards in play and use the cards you have to affect the world.
