## Chapter 8: The BattleField

## The Environment
Combat can happen in a variety of locations and with a myriad of different terrain. These changes to the environment combat occurs in can impose different rules upon the battle. At the start of combat the Dealer will declare any obvious environmental effects to the Players and how they affect gameplay. Detailed here are a few basic features of the environment which will always be relevant to combat.

### Light
How well lit an area is can greatly impact not only combat but many aspects of gameplay. This aspect of an area is represented by a Light Level, a numerical value which grows as an area becomes more brightly lit. Detailed below are the possible light levels and their effects on combat and general gameplay.

**4+:** Unbearably bright. All [Sun]  damage is increased by 1 per light level above 5. All creatures without [Sun] immunity or [Sun] resistance greater than the Light Level gain the Blinded condition. Decrease all [Sea] or [Void] damage by 4. The map is obscured during combat.

**3:** Uncomfortably bright. Any creature without [Sun] resistance or immunity gains the Blinded Condition while in this light. This Condition can be removed until your next turn by using an Action to cover your eyes.

**2:** Normal brightness. No default effects.

**1:** Low light level. Creatures without [Void] resistance or immunity gain the Blinded Condition while in this light level. This Condition can be removed until your next turn by using an Action to observe more closely.

**0:** Total darkness. All creatures gain the Blinded Condition.

**Negative:** Unnatural darkness. Achievable only by magic. Reduce all [Sun] and [Sky] damage by 1 and increase all [Void] damage by 1 for each Light Level below 0. All Creatures gain the Blinded Condition. The map is obscured during combat.

### Terrain
The ground you stand on provides the foundation on which combat occurs. Terrain can have several qualities which affect movement and combat as a whole. The most common of these are Rough Terrain and Hazardous Terrain. Each of these incurs an inclement effect on any creature moving across that terrain, which can be reduced or ignored with an appropriate resistance of immunity.
**Rough Terrain:** All movement across Rough Terrain costs 1 additional point of speed per unit moved. This effect is ignored if you have either a resistance or immunity to the effect which caused the terrain to be rough. Rough Terrain is often caused by uneven ground, dense foliage, or frozen surfaces.
**Hazardous Terrain:** All movement across Hazardous Terrain deals 1 point of damage per unit moved to any creature moving across it. Resistance applies to this movement as if it were one source. For instance, if you have [Earth] resistance 3 you can ignore the first 3 damage taken from Hazardous Terrain with the [Earth] tag, but take full damage after that point. Hazardous Terrain is often caused by sharp or jagged rocks, heated materials, or otherwise harmful surfaces.

## Conditions
During combat and occasionally as you traverse the world a Feature or other effect will inflict or bestow a condition on you. Conditions are passive effects which can affect your character in a variety of ways both positive and negative. A list of all Conditions and their effects can be found in Appendix C at the end of this book.

### Condition Tags
Like many other aspects of _DYW_ Conditions may have Tags attached to them Generally these denote a damage type or category the Condition falls into. However there are a few which carry inherent meaning. These are listed below

**Basic:** This Condition can be gained by any player character through some simple execution of the game rules. For instance, any character can gain the Broken Condition when their Current Guard is reduced to 0.

**Stacks:** This Condition may be applied to the same creature more than once. These carry a numerical value which is increased by 1 with each stack
