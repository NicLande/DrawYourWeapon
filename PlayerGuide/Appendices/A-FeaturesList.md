| Aeromancy Adept      | While you have at least two Spades Cards in Hand you may command the powers of nearby sky elementals to manipulate the air and skies around you. When you are within a strong storm you can use an Action to reduce its intensity within up to 10 units of yourself. Any creatures within that radius experience half of the normal negative effects from this weather. Any effect which cannot be halved is instead suppressed. This reduction in the storm’s strength follows you as you move and lasts for 1 minute. In addition, you may use this Feature to Attack. Play two Spades Cards and target any creature within 5 units. You may then target an additional creature within 5 units of your initial target. You may repeat this a number of times up to half the Value of the Card you Played. Each targeted creature then takes 5+Attacking Player’s Might damage. You may then look at a number of Cards from the top of the Library equal to the number of creatures damaged by this Feature. You may then place each of these Cards on the top or bottom of the Library in any order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | "Aeromancy Novice,                                |                           |       |

| Aeromancy Master     | While you have at least three Spade Cards in Hand you may dominate all Sky magic in the region around you, controlling the winds as an extension of your own body. You can induce or remove any weather effects in the skies so long as they deal no damage. If you are within a weather effect which causes damage you may reduce that damage by half. Doing either of these uses an Action and lasts for ten minutes. In addition, you can use this Feature to attack any creature within 10 units of yourself. Play 3 Spade Cards, the target takes 10+Attacking Player’s Might damage. You may then search the Library for any Card which is not a Joker and place it into your Hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | "Aeromancy Adept,                                 |                           |       |

| Aeromancy Novice     | While you have a Spade Card in Hand you can feel the moving of the wind more intimately than most, and can manipulate it to your advantage. You can sense whenever a creature within 10 units of you moves, but not its direction or speed. When you sense this movement, if the source is flying, you can use an Action to speed it up or slow it down. When you do so you can increase or decrease its Speed by up to the value of the highest Spades card in your Hand. In addition, you can strike creatures with the power of the sky. As an Attack on your turn you can play a Spades card and strike a creature within 10 Units of you with a torrent of wind. The struck creature takes 1 damage + your Might. You may then look at the top Card of the Library and either place it back on top or at the bottom of the Library. If you played an Odd Card for this Attack you may instead look at the top two Cards and place both on the top or bottom of the Library in an order of your choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Sky Affinity                                      | Magical, Sky              | 4     |
| Alchemy Adept        | When you use the Basic Craft Feature you may create a potion instead. You play a Card and expend Reserve in the same manner as per Basic Craft but the Key Item you craft has properties based on the suit of the Card used to craft it: Diamonds {When this item is used its user gains the ability to breathe fire for 1 minute.

| Geomancy Adept       | While you have at least two Clubs Cards in Hand you may command the powers of nearby earth elementals to encourage and control plant life. As an Action you can cause any plant you can touch to grow rapidly up to double its size. This growth stops if it would damage any structures or creatures. You can influence the direction and shape of this growth, but cannot cause it to grow in a way which would not be naturally possible. For instance, you can cause fruits to grow in the shape of a cube as that is possible under natural circumstances but you may not grow a plant with leaves as sharp as a blade from a normal tree. In addition, you can use this Feature to attack creatures around you. To do this you must Play two Club Cards. When you do so all creatures on the ground within 5 units of you take 5 + your Attacking Player’s Might damage and you may reorder Cards in the Pile. After playing your Cards you may freely reorder the Cards from the top of the Pile as deep as the greater of the two Values you Played.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Geomancy Novice, Level 3                          | Attack, Magical, Earth    | 4     |
| Geomancy Master      | While you have at least three Club Cards in Hand you can dominate all of the Earth magic around you. As an Action you may mold any dirt, stone, or other earthen terrain around you. When you do so you can move up to 1 ton of material up to 1 unit. This movement cannot deal damage but can displace creatures. When you move terrain a creature is standing on it may attempt a Finesse [Spades] Test with a threshold equal to the highest Spade Card in your Hand. In addition you can use this Feature to Attack. Play three Spade Cards and target a creature within 5 units of you. The targeted creature takes 10+Attacking Player’s Might damage. After dealing this damage you must shuffle the Pile and Draw the top Card. You may then search through the Pile and place a Card of your choice on top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Geomancy Adept, Level 7                           | Magical, Earth            | 4     |
| Geomancy Novice      | While you have a Clubs card in hand you can manipulate the Earth and Plants slightly. By spending time with plant life or inspecting the nearby terrain you can learn simple details about the recent past. Plantlife can inform you of recent weather and animals which affected the area, and explain any damage they have received. Terrain can point out features of the environment which have been recently added such as tracks, lost items, and recently cast magic. The information becomes cloudy and obscured to the caster if it occurred a number of hours ago greater than the value of the Clubs Card in their hand. In addition, they may channel the power of the earth to attack foes. As an Action you may Attack an enemy within 5 units of yourself. To do so Play a Clubs Card. The target then takes 1+ Attacking Player's Might damage and you may reorder the top Cards of the Pile. After Playing your Card you may take a Card from the Pile up to as deep as the Value of the Card you Played and place it on top of the Pile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Earth Affinity                                    | Magical, Earth            | 4     |

| Greater Healer       | All of your Abilities which can heal a creature are enhanced. Whenever the text of a Feature which restores HP calls for the lower of two values it instead takes the greater.

| Hydromancy Adept     | While you have at least two Heart Cards in Hand you may command the powers of nearby sea elementals to draw water from the atmosphere. As an Action you may fill a container no larger than a gallon with fresh water. You may only do this so long as the air around the object has enough humidity. Taking this Action lowers the humidity in the area noticeably. In addition, you may use this Feature to attack creatures by Playing two Hearts Cards. You target a creature within 5 units of yourself and deal 5 + Attacking Player's Might in damage to the target. You may then force the Dealer to swap a Card in their Hand with a Card from another Player’s hand of your choice, provided that that Player’s character is within 5 units of you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | "Hydromancy Novice,                               |                           |       |

| Hydromancy Master    | While you have at least three Heart Cards in Hand you may dominate all Sea magic around you. You can use an Action to induce flow into any body of water within 50 units of you. When you do so target any body of water 1 gallon or larger and choose a direction and strength for the flow. You may not apply enough force to damage creatures within the water. The flow lasts for one minute. Creatures within the body of water may attempt a Might [Clubs] Test to resist being moved by the flow. The threshold of this Test is equal to the Value of the highest Hearts Card in your Hand. You may also use this Feature to make an Attack by playing three Heart Cards. When you do so, target a creature within 5 units of yourself. The target then takes 10+Attacking Player’s Might damage. You may then swap Hands with the Dealer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Hydromancy Adept, Level 7                         | Magical, Sea              | 4     |
| Hydromancy Novice    | While you have a Hearts card in hand you can manipulate the flow of water and some other fluids near you. As an Action while you have a Hearts card in Hand you may redirect the flow of Water or another fluid of similar viscosity and elemental origin at the Dealer's discretion (note: an example of a non-manipulable fluid is Lava as it is both too viscous and is tied elementally to Earth). This redirection of flow can be otherwise impossible such as flowing uphill or over an object but may not deal damage that the flow would not normally be capable of, and is limited in volume by the Value of the Hearts card in hand. The volume of the water manipulated cannot exceed a number of gallons equal to 10 times the Value of the greatest Hearts Card in the Caster's Hand. In addition, the caster may use ambient hydration to attack creatures in combat. As an Attack the Caster may play a Hearts card and deal damage to a target within 5 units of them equal to 1 + Attacking Player's Might. If the attack deals damage the Dealer must then swap one card at random from their hand with a card from the Caster's hand of the Caster's choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sea Affinity                                      | Magical, Sea              | 4     |
| Inspiring Presence   | While the top Card of the Pile is a facecard your fellow Players may treat some of the Cards in your Hand as if they were in their Hand if you allow it. When the top Card of the Pile becomes a facecard you may select a number of Cards from your Hand up to your Charm attribute. You may change your selections as an Action. The other Players at the table may choose any of these Cards and treat them as though they were in their Hand as well as yours. The chosen Cards count towards the other Player’s Hand size only if they use them for a Feature. In order for Players to use these Cards they must be within 5 units of yourself and able to hear you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Charm 3+                                          | Skill, Social             | 3     |

| Invigorating Shot    | Whenever you restore HP to a creature you may expend 2 Reserve in order to double the HP they receive, fully refill their Speed and Guard and allow them to Draw a Card. In addition the next time your target deals damage it is doubled. At the end of the target’s next turn they drop to 0 Current HP and gain the Dying Condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Any [Healing] Feature, Level 10+                  | Healing                   | 6     |

| Parry                | While you have a Shield or [Melee] Weapon equipped and another creature Attacks you while within 5 feet of you, if their attack fails to break your Guard you may knock that creature off balance.

If they are already last in Initiative they must choose the other option. If they can choose neither option they lose their turn for the round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Might 2+                                          | Skill                     | 4     |

If they choose to do so they recover Health equal to your Level+your Charm or the Value of the Hearts card in your hand, whichever is lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                   | Skill, Healing            | 3     |

| Pyromancy Master     | While you have at least Three Diamonds Cards in Hand you may empower any nearby sun elementals to ignite all flammable objects within a number of units equal to your Int which aren't being worn or carried. In addition you may snuff out any small flames within this same range and double the size of any flames within this range. Lastly you may use this Feature to devastate all creatures around you by playing three Diamonds Cards. When you do so every creature within your reach takes damage equal to the Value of the highest Card played. Every creature beyond your reach but within Units equal to your Int takes damage equal to the Value of the middle card Played. Any creatures beyond this range but within a number of Units equal to twice your Int take damage equal to the Value of the lowest Card played.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Pyromancy Adept, Level 7                          | Magical, Sun              | 4     |
| Pyromancy Novice     | While you have at least one Diamonds card in your Hand and have at least one free hand you may call upon the powers of nearby fire elementals to produce an orb of light in your palm. This orb hovers a few inches above your palm and you can manipulate it to move about your hand a few feet. The orb manifests as a harmless light source with no other effects or a dangerous flame which can burn foes and ignite objects. The harmless light raises the light level by 1 within 10 units of you. The dangerous flame raises the light level by 1 within 5 units of you and ignites any unattended flammable object it touches. You may use the dangerous flame to attack a creature in melee combat by playing a Diamonds card. Doing so deals fire damage to yourself and your target equal to half the Value of the card played or your Intelligence, whichever is lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Sun Affinity                                      | Magical, Sun              | 4     |

If the amount of Reserve spent was higher than the amount you possess the potion fizzles out and loses all potency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Alchemy Adept                                     | Alchemy                   | 3     |

| Subtle Caster        | While you have any Pair of Cards in your Hand you may mask magic yourself as the source of magic. Any observer trying to identify the source of magic you have cast must make an Intelligence[Diamonds] Test with a difficulty equal to the Value of the Pair’s parts. On a success they identify you as the source of the magic. On a failure they can detect the magic but not its source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Any [Magical] Feature                             | Social, Skill, Magical    | 3     |

| Umbramancy Adept     | You gain the ability to leverage the darkness against specific targets. As an Action you may target either a Player or an NPC within 5 units of you. That target’s controller must have fewer Cards in Hand than the size of the Void. You may choose to either obscure that creature’s senses or other creature’s ability to perceive them. You may choose to either inflict Blindness on the target or grant them Invisibility. This effect lasts for 1 minute per Card in the Void beyond the size of the target’s hand. The target may end the effect early by Discarding a Card from their Hand. In addition, while a creature is under one of these effects you may strike them with an Attack. There is no limit to the range on this Attack. Discard a Card from your Hand and deal 5+Attacking Player’s Might damage to the target. They then immediately Discard a Card and the effect ends on them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | "Umbramancy Novice,                               |                           |       |

| Umbramancy Master    | While the Void is larger than the Library you gain the ability to call upon the darkest elementals in all the realms. As an Action you can blind all creatures within 10 units of you besides yourself. Each creature may attempt a Wits [Hearts] Test to resist this effect. The threshold for this Test is equal to the number of Cards of a Suit of your choice in the Void. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. In addition, you may use this Feature to Attack a creature within 5 units of you by Discarding your entire Hand. When you do so the target takes 10+Attacking Player’s Might damage and discards their entire hand. You may then Draw a Card of your choice from the Void.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Umbramancy Adept, Level 7                         | Magical, Void             | 4     |
| Umbramancy Novice    | While the Void has more Cards in it than you have in your Hand you can pull darkness from the depths of the multiverse to drain nearby light. As an action you can lower the light level within 10 Units of yourself by 1 level. This darkness lasts until you dismiss it as an Action or the Dealer's Hand becomes larger than the Void. This Ability does not stack with Features that create darkness. In addition, as an Attack on your turn you may drain the life from a creature near you. While you have a hand free you can strike a creature within 1 unit of you with negative energy. The creature takes damage equal to 1 plus your Might. The Dealer and you each Discard a Card at random from your Hands. If you do not have any Cards left in your Hand to Discard you instead take damage equal to the number of Cards in the Void.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Void Affinity                                     | Magical, Void             | 4     |
