## Chapter 5: Actions
---

When a Player wishes for their Character to carry out some task this is often represented by an Action. There are several types of Actions, each with different conditions and effects. While not everything a Character does must be an Action, nearly everything will be and Dealers and Players should be clear when a specific Action is being invoked. When outside of Combat, Actions do not take a specific amount of time and their duration is defined by the Dealer or their specific wording.

## Tests
At any point, you may choose to have your character interact with the world or other characters. It is up to the Dealer whether your character is able to freely engage in an interaction, or if you must utilize a mixture of skill and luck to perform a Test.  
When attempting a Test the Dealer will assign a Suit and Attribute which align with the situation causing the Test. For instance, if you are attempting to kick down a door the Dealer will likely require a [Might] Clubs Test. When attempting a Test if the Card you use corresponds to the Suit allocated by the Dealer you may add your Attribute to the Result.
### Contests
When attempting a Test where the hurdle is another Player or an NPC you must compete to see who succeeds on the Test. Each character involved in the conflicts selects a Card to Play simultaneously with the highest Result emerging victorious. For example, if two characters, Morgan and Julian, attempt an arm wrestling match the Dealer may call for a [Might] Clubs Contest. Julian plays the 8 of Hearts and Morgan plays the 7 of Clubs. Ordinarily Julian would win, however Morgan adds his 2 might to his Result and reaches a total of 9. After this addition Morgan is declared the winner and slams Julian’s arm down onto the table. 
Contests may have more than one participant. Every character who fails a Contest draws a new Card.
In the event of a tie a Player will always win agains the Dealer. If the tie is between two Players then the Player with the greater number of Cards in Hand wins, if that number is still the same then the winner is determined randomly.

### Skill Test
If the Test you are attempting is difficult due to its inherent nature or the circumstances surrounding it a Skill Test is required. In this case, as with a Contest, the characters attempting the Test Play a Card from their Hand in order to succeed. Secretly, before the Card is played the Dealer determines the required Result to pass the Skill Test. If the Character fails they gain one Experience.

### Surprises
Occasionally, the Dealer will call for a Test without the prompting of a Player’s actions. In cases like these, such as attacks from enemies or traps in the environment, the Test will be handled as a Surprise. A Surprise can be either a Contest or a Skill Test. They act as normal, except the surprised character Plays the top Card of the Deck directly to the Pile rather than a Card from their Hand. In addition to the normal rewards for succeeding the successful party may also add the Played card to their hand if they wish.

## Attacks
When a Player wants to hurt another creature or an object in the world, this is usually accomplished through the use of the Attack Action. There are multiple kinds of Attacks in _Draw Your Weapon_ based on the kind of weapon you are wielding and the method with which you choose to attack.

### Simple Strike
A simple strike may be performed at any time a character is not restricted in some way. It most often represents a simple punch or kick as it does not require a weapon to be used. You may still use a Simple Strike even while your hands are occupied.
A Simple Strike is executed by a Player Playing a Card from their Hand. They may then deal an amount of damage equal to one plus half their might (rounded down) to any creature or object within their reach or in their hands.

### Weapon Attack
Weapon Attacks may only be used when your character has a weapon equipped in at least one hand. Each individual weapon has unique rules regarding their range and abilities which can be found listed with their stats. However, there are a few important properties which all weapons have which allow you to make attacks with them.
All weapons have a Value range. This defines the maximum and minimum Value of the cards you can play to attack with the weapon. Weapons may also have associated suits listed. In order to Attack with a weapon you must play a Card within their Value range. Your Attack will deal an amount of damage to the enemy equal to the Result of the Attack. The Result is calculated by taking the Value of the Card and adding your Might if the Suit of the Card you played matches that of the weapon you used. Otherwise, the Result is equal to just the Value of the Card.

### Special Attack
Some characters will have Features which allow them to make an Attack, or which modify your Attack action. Some examples of this include the Cheap Shot Feature and some [Magical] Features. When a Feature has the [Attack] tag Actions with that Feature count as an Attack Action rather than the Use Ability action.

## Moving
The Move action does not encompass all forms of movement. Sidestepping, idling, and slow walking do not count as taking the Move action. Moving reflects the ability of your character to Move quickly, not just by running but also by reacting to events or avoiding danger. When the main motive of your character is to quickly get into, out of, or change a situation that will likely be a Move Action. While the Dealer may rule that other situations call for the use of the Move Action there are only two predefined uses.

### Combat Move
While in Combat you may move yourself on your turn without the use of an Action, however doing so consumes your Speed. This is further detailed in Chapter 9. When you take the Combat Move option you refresh your Speed to its maximum value.

### Dash
While not in combat you may take a Move action to Dash. This restricts your character’s ability to take other Actions while moving but causes you to break into a full sprint, the speed of which is determined by your Speed stat.

## Defending
When in a dangerous situation where danger may lurk around the corner, you may wish to take the Defend Action in order to remain alert to danger. When your character is keeping watch or in combat if you have a moment to spare to brace yourself for damage you may use the Defend Action.
When Defending you become immune to Surprise Tests. When the Dealer would subject you to a Surprise Test you may choose to instead treat it as if it were not a surprise. You take the rewards and consolations as you normally would for whichever type of test you elect to treat it as. You are considered to be Defending until you take any other Action.

### Guard
While in Combat taking the Defend Action has additional effects. In addition to being immune to Surprise Tests you may also add your Guard Refresh to your Current Guard. If you have the Broken condition you instead remove that condition.

## Use Ability
The most broad of the Actions, Use Ability allows for the use of all of your Character’s Features which are active in use but are not associated with another Action. For instance, the Sleuth Feature may be used either in conjunction with a Skill Test or on its own. If the player elects for the latter then it is used as a Use Ability Action.


## Breathers
When characters need to rest, but cannot afford to take the many hours or days needed to fully recover they may opt to take a Breather. Taking a Breather takes just 10 minutes in game, but the party may only take up to two Breathers before they must use the Rest Action to fully recover. There are a few basic uses for a Breather, each of which counts as an Action of its own. When taking the Breather Action select one of the following Sub-Actions to gain the benefits of.

### Recover
A Player may need to restore some of their character’s expended Stats. If they use their Breather to Recover they select two Stats from HP, Reserve, and Clout. They may regain an amount to each equal to the associated Attribute times their Level.

### Trade
Players may elect jointly to have their characters rest together, sharing stories and equipment. This activity allows the Players to trade one card with another Player, and may spend Reserve or Clout to replenish their ally’s resources. Each Player may only trade a single Card each Breather and they may not trade Reserve and Clout of an amount greater than the Value of the higher Traded Card.



### Use Ability
Some Abilities activate during a Breather and require the character’s full attention, preventing them from using the other two options.

## Resting
When the Party has exhausted their resources or simply wish to recover fully before a grand adventure they may elect to take the Rest Action. A Resting character is unconscious and cannot take any other Actions unless they are awoken or complete the Rest. Resting typically takes 8 hours but at the Dealer’s discretion may take longer or shorter. When a Rest is completed by any Player Character The Pile is discarded into the Void. 
After Resting a Player Character may regain an amount of HP equal to the combined Value of every Card in their Hand. If this total is less than their Endurance plus their Level they instead regain that much HP. Immediately after healing the Player Discards their Hand into the Void and Draws five new Cards from the Library. If there are any effects which prevent the Player from Discarding their Hand they also do not regain the HP.
