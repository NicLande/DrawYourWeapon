## Chapter 2: Character Creation
---

### Guide
After your group has decided when and where to play and who will be the Dealer you all must work together to create a party of characters to adventure together. This process should be collaborative, with many aspects involving input from the rest of the table, but your character is yours to mold and shape. You make the decisions on how they are built and what their path will be. In order to create your character you will select several aspects of them from lists and others will be purchased with Build. At the end of this chapter you should have the full understanding of all the aspects which go into creating a character in _DYW_.

**Character Concept** The first step to creating your character is deciding on an overall concept. This concept will define what choices you make going through the process. Perhaps you wish to master the blade and focus on making choices which enhance your ability to wield bladed weapons. Maybe you want to play a mage who commands the very elements themselves. It may even be that you wish to play a character who avoids combat in favor of supporting the rest of the party through social skills or medicine. Regardless of your choice, communicate with the others at the table to ensure that you are creating a well rounded and dynamic party. 

**Name** In addition to an overall concept which defines your character you will need to name the person you play as. The name of a character is not important for their abilities and features, however it can help define and communicate their personality. When you have decided upon a name write it down in the name section of the character sheet.

**Appearance** Similarly to their name, a character's appearance has no bearing on their abilities. However, you and the rest of the party should be aware of the basic appearance of the characters you are playing with, as it may affect the story. If you are artistically inclined you may draw some notable aspects of your character on the figure on the character sheet.

**Signature Ability:** Next comes your character’s Signature Ability. This is a central pillar of your character and grants them several free Features, Equipment, and other benefits as they gain Levels. This costs no Build. When you have selected your Signature Ability you may note down the name of your choice and a brief description in the Signature Ability section of your character sheet. The full text can be written in the Features Details section on the back side of the character sheet.

**Style:** After you determine your Attributes you must select your character’s Style from a list. This is the most apparent character trait of your character and determines how you will primarily Draw Cards. This costs no Build. Once you have selected your Style you may write its name and description in the Style section of your character sheet.

**Relationships:** With the basics of your character defined you can now define how they relate to the other characters being made at the table. Discuss with each other Player how your characters would know each other, if they do. This costs no Build. Each time you select a relationship you can note the character with whom you have a relation in the Character side of the Relationship List section of your character sheet, followed by the name of the relationship in the adjacent Relation side. The full description, as well as the story behind your relationship, in the Relationships Details section on the back of the character sheet.

**Build:** You begin the character creation process with 12 Build, which is used as a currency in order to create your character. Build is spent on your Attributes, Features, and Equipment with any leftover being converted into Experience at the end of the process.

**Attributes:** The first step of spending your Build is to define your character's attributes. These are six values which shape the basic abilities of your character. Each starts at 0; in order to upgrade them you must cumulatively spend Build equal to the value of the value you wish to upgrade it to. The maximum value an attribute can reach is 5, which is not possible to achieve through character creation and must be acquired at a later level. Once your Attributes have been decided you may not each in the appropriate space within the attributes & stats section of your character sheet. In addition, you may fill in the appropriate value for the derived stat as detailed later in this chapter.

| Value | Build Cost |
|-------|------------|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

**Features:** After gaining your central Features from your Signature Ability you may spend Build on additional Features. These allow your character to perform a variety of Actions and grant many passive benefits. Their Build costs are listed in their descriptions. Once you have selected a Feature you may add its name and tags to the Feature List section of your character sheet, and a full description to the Features Details section on the back of you character sheet.

**Inventory:** The final step in creating a character is determining what items they carry on them. You may purchase Equipment in the same manner you purchased Features. The list of Equipment is located at the end of this book in Appendix B. Note the stats of the item in Inventory section of your character sheet when you acquire an item. Whenever you equip an item you may add it to the section numbered to correspond to the location it is equipped to. 

**Finish Up:** If you have any Build remaining at the end of the character creation process you may go back to earlier steps and spend it, or save it for later where it is converted into Experience to spend at a later time.


### Signature Abilities
Every Player Character in _DYW_  has a diverse collection of skills, abilities, and qualities. However, in order to help realize certain archetypal characters you will select a Signature Ability which grants you an assortment of unique abilities and grants you Features you would otherwise need to purchase during character creation or with Experience later in the game.

#### Initial Benefits
When you create a character you must select a Signature Ability from the list below. Initially this will grant you a few core Features and grant you certain benefits unique to your Signature Ability. These Features will help to define your character’s core play style. Certain Signature Abilities also grant you the option to select Equipment or Features with certain restrictions.

#### Abilities at Higher Levels
Your Signature Ability will also grow with you. As you gain Levels you will occasionally be granted further Features and benefits from your Signature Ability. If you already had any of these Features you may instead select any Feature with a cost less than or equal to the Feature you would have gained from your Signature Ability.

### Style
Every Player Character will have a Style, a general attitude towards problem solving which guides their decision making and abilities. Each Style grants a special, unique ability which allows you to draw cards as an action or under a special condition. While this is the only mechanical impact of your Style, they are also meant to reflect a large aspect of your Player Character’s demeanor, morals, or impression on others. There are no penalties towards acting against your Player Character’s Style, as all people are multifaceted and may act in contradictory ways, however if you never or only rarely act in accordance with your Style the Dealer may ask you to switch to another which suits your actions in game more closely. 

#### Choosing a Style
After determining your character’s Attributes you may select their Style from the following list. The list includes an abbreviated description of how the Ability functions for that Style, and a full description follows in the section after.

| Style Name | Draw | Cost |
|------------|------|------|
|Cautious | Draw a Card | The Dealer Draws a Card |
|Cowardly | Draw a Card | Discard the top Cards of the Pile equal to your Hand Size |
| Deceitful | Draw a Card | Discard a Card from the Deck |
| Determined | Draw a Card | Play the top two cards from the Deck |
| Generous | Give one Card to another Player | The Dealer takes the top Card from the Pile, Deck, or a card from your Void |
|Honorable | Draw a Card, Reveal that Card | The Dealer Draws a Card and then Reveals it |
| Insightful | Draw one of the top two Cards from the Deck after looking at them | The Dealer draws a Card from the Void |
| Jealous | Take another Player's Card from their Hand randomly | Only if you have the fewest Cards in Hand |
| Opportunistic | Draw the top Card of the Pile | Discard the top card of the Deck |

#### Styles List


**Cautious**  
    As an Action you may Draw a Card from the Deck. When you do so the Dealer may also Draw a Card from their Deck. 

**Cowardly**  
    As an Action you may Draw a Card. Immediately after that you must Discard a number of Cards from the top of the Player Pile into the Void equal to the new size of your Hand. If the Pile is smaller than your Hand, Discard the remaining Cards from the top of the Deck.

**Deceitful**  
    As an Action you may Draw a Card from the Deck. If you do so you must immediately then Discard the top Card of the Deck into your Void.

**Determined**  
    As an Action you may Draw a Card from the Deck. After doing so you must immediately Play the top two Cards of the Deck.

**Generous**  
    As an Action you may have another Player Draw a Card of your choice from your Hand. After this, you may Draw a Card from the Deck. Finally, the Dealer may Draw the top Card of the Deck, Pile, or any Card from your Void.

**Honorable**  
    As an Action you may Draw a Card from the Deck. You must then reveal the Card to the Players and the Dealer. When you do so the Dealer may also Draw a Card from their Deck and must also reveal that Card to every Player. 

**Insightful**  
    As an Action you may look at the top two Cards of the Deck and then Draw one. You then must place the other Card back on top of the Deck. After all of this, the Dealer may Draw a Card of their choice from either their Void or your Void. If both Voids are empty they may instead Draw the top two Cards of their Deck.

**Jealous**  
    As an Action you may Draw a random Card from another Player’s Hand. In order to do so you must have the smallest Hand size of any Player. If you are tied for the smallest Hand Size you may only Draw a Card from a larger Hand than your own.

**Opportunistic**  
    As an Action you may Draw the top Card of the Pile. No Card may ever enter your Hand this way if it has already been in your Hand this session. After Drawing a Card this way you must Discard the top Card of each Deck into their respective Void.

### Relationships
Your character does not exist on their own; _DYW_  is played as part of a party of characters. The dynamics between your characters can often form the narrative and emotional core of the stories told with this system. To represent some aspects of the party dynamic you are able to define your Relationship to each of the other characters in your party at character creation. These Relationships give niche mechanical abilities but are also a narrative tool for yourself and the other Players to help advance the story  of the game.  
#### Acquiring Relationships
During the character creation process you will ideally be speaking to the other Players and the Dealer about the kind of game you wish to play and the character you wish to inhabit within that game. Once each of you has a rough idea of the type of character you are building you can each choose to define your relationship to one another. When you do so select a relationship from the list below. The relationship you select is given to yourself and another Player who agrees to the relationship. Each relationship grants a Feature to your character. Some relationships grant a different Feature to each person in the relationship, based on their position within that relationship. In this case, you and the Player who have this relationship must agree on who holds each part of the relationship, and gain the corresponding Feature. For instance, Bodyguard/VIP requires one player to take on the role of the Bodyguard and the other to hold the position of the VIP. Once you have made your choice make sure to discuss the specifics of the Relationship with the Dealer and the other Player. Guidance on what questions to answer are provided in the description of each Relationship, but the depth and breadth of the questions you answer are up to yourself and the other Player.

### Attributes
As a Player Character in _Draw Your Weapon_ your ability to perform certain kinds of actions are defined by certain Attributes your character has. These Attributes roughly determine your affinity and skill with certain types of actions. The five Attributes are Might, Endurance, Finesse, Intelligence, Wits, and Charm. For Player Characters these abilities may not be lower than 0 (slightly below average for a normal person) or higher than 5 (beyond the peak of an ordinary person).

#### Derived Stats
Each Attribute has a Stat linked to it which derives its value from the value of the attribute. Each of these has a function in the game and serves multiple functions. Each of these Stats basic function and value are explained along with their linked Attribute.

#### Determining Attributes
In order to determine your Player Character’s Attributes at level 1 you spend points and allocate them as you wish. You have 10 points to spend as you wish. Each Attribute begins at 0 and grows by 1 for each point spent. No Attribute may exceed 5.

> #### Optional Rule: Negative Scores
> In the exceptional case where to accurately represent a character you need a score which falls below 0. In this case, if your Dealer agrees, you may lower a score of your choice to -1 and gain one extra point to spend on your other Attributes. When a score has a value of -1 and that Attribute can be applied to a Test, Attack, or other form of Played Card rather than adding the Score if you Play a Card of a specific Suit you add the Score in the event that you fail to Play the Card of the associated Suit.

**Endurance**
Endurance measures a Player Character’s health and wellbeing. The constitution, stamina, and grit of a character relies on their Endurance Score. Endurance is most often associated with Clubs and Hearts.

__*HP*__
HP is the Stat linked with Endurance. It represents the amount of damage your character can withstand before collapsing. HP is a resource which can be lost and gained throughout playing _DYW_. You gain no innate benefits from having it and there are no penalties when losing it until you reach 0. When you run out of HP your character will begin to die. This process is outlined in the Combat chapter. You cannot go above your Maximum HP.  
Your maximum HP is defined at 5+(Your Endurance*Your Level)+(Level Bonus)+(Other Bonuses). You begin play with Current HP equal to your Maximum.

**Finesse**
A character’s dexterity, speed, and fine motor control are all represented by their Finesse score. Finesse is most often used in reference to checks regarding balancing, using tools, operating vehicles, or feats of acrobatics. Finesse is most often associated with Spades and Diamonds.

__*Speed*__
Speed is the Stat linked to Finesse. Speed defines not only your ability to move but also your ability to quickly execute tasks while under pressure. Whenever you move in combat you consume Speed. Moving 1 unit, drawing a weapon, and executing a simple task while in combat all consume 1 Speed. Much like Guard and HP you cannot go above your Maximum Speed.  
Your Speed is defined as 5+(Your Finesse)+(Other Bonuses)+(Level Bonus). At Level 1 your Level Bonus is 0 and is further explained in Chapter 3.

**Wits**
The Wits score of a Player Character is representative of their ability to read a situation, adapt well under pressure, and understand complex social dynamics. Wits is most often used to resolve interactions regarding reading the intent of another person, solving puzzles, or perceiving dangerous surroundings. This Score is most often associated with Spades and Hearts.

__*Max Hand Size*__
Max Hand Size is the Stat linked with Wits. It is a representation of your ability to collect and utilize whatever situation you find yourself in to your advantage.  Your Max Hand Size impacts only the maximum number of Cards you may have in your Hand at any given time. The details of this are covered in Chapter 4.  
Your Max Hand Size is defined as 5+(Your Wits)+(Level Bonus). At Level 1 your Level Bonus is 0 and is further explained in Chapter 3.

**Intelligence**
Intelligence is a representation of your Player Character’s learned knowledge, ability to piece together information, and confidently put their knowledge to use. This Attribute is most often used to determine a character’s ability to apply knowledge they have, recall information, and do research. This Score is most often associated with Clubs  and Diamonds.

__*Reserve*__
Reserve is the Stat linked with Intelligence. It is a representation of how prepared your character is for any situation. Whenever a situation calls for equipment or strategic forethought that your character does not explicitly have the ability to accomplish you may expend Reserve to make up that deficit. Whenever you make a Test involving a situation wherein your situation would be made possible or easier by having certain equipment or a specific plan in place beforehand you may expend Reserve to lower the Target by an amount equal to the amount spent. At the discretion of the Dealer you may also expend Reserve to complete Tests without Playing a Card or to accomplish simple tasks which require certain equipment. The expenditure of Reserve represents your character running low on expendable resources and plans, while at 0 Reserve you may find that your character fails to produce items which you otherwise take for granted such as torches or food. As with the other Stats which are used as a resource you may not exceed your Reserve’s maximum.
Your Reserve is defined as 5+(Your Intelligence*Your Level)+(Level Bonus)+(Other Bonuses). You begin the game with all of your Reserve.

**Charm**
A character who can speak well, collect their thoughts effectively, and inspire others will have a correspondingly high Charm. Charm is most often used in the resolution of tests involving deceiving another person, inspiring another person, or persuading someone. Charm is most often associated with Diamonds and Hearts.

__*Clout*__
Clout is the Stat linked with Charm. It is a representation of your social pull. Unlike the other Stats this value may fluctuate frequently based on the location around you. As such, the value on your character sheet should be assumed as a default rather than the definitive value. Clout acts similarly to Reserve, but serves a different function. Clout may be used to lower the Target of a Test in the same way as Reserve, however the Test must involve some form of social manipulation or understanding. Where Reserve may be used to produce a rope to climb a wall, Clout may be used to convince a passing guardsman there is no reason to be suspicious. The expenditure of Clout indicates that those around you may be growing impatient, distrustful, or hurt by your actions and should be expended carefully. As with the other Stats which are used as a resource you may not exceed your Clout’s maximum.
Your Clout is defined as 5+(Your Charm*Your Level)+(Level Bonus)+(Other Bonuses)+(Any Modifiers From The Dealer). You begin the game with all of your Clout.

**Might**
A Player Character’s physical strength is represented by their Might Score. The ability to lift and carry objects, the strength of their weapon strikes, and contests of power are all often resolved by referencing a character’s Might. Might is most often associated with Clubs and Spades.

__*Guard*__ 
Guard is the Stat linked to Might. It represents your ability to react to attacks and take damage without getting hurt. Guard is made up of three Values: Current Guard, Guard Refresh, and Maximum Guard.
Whenever you take damage from a source with no tags or a weapon you take the damage to your Current Guard before it applies to your HP. If your Current Guard is reduced to 0 you gain the Broken Condition. Guard Refresh represents how much Guard you gain when you take the Defend Action. Maximum Guard is the maximum amount your Current Guard can reach. If you would gain Guard and go above your Maximum you stop after reaching Maximum.
Your Current Guard begins at 0. Your Guard Refresh is defined as 1+(Level Bonus)+(Other Bonuses). Your Maximum Guard begins at 5+(Your Might*Your Level)+(Other Bonuses).




  

### Features
Every character has Features which represent their unique qualities and affinities in ways Attributes and a Style alone cannot. Features can affect both the world of the game and the mechanics of your character. They may allow you to take a special action, modify an existing action, grant you a passive bonus, or more.


#### Acquiring Features
In order to acquire a Feature you must meet two conditions. Firstly, you must meet all Prerequisites listed on the description of the Feature. Then you must spend an amount of Build equal to the Value of the Feature. You may then add the Feature to your character sheet.
If a Feature has a prerequisite you do not yet meet but can acquire through character creation you may acquire the Feature so long as you meet the prerequisite after completing character creation.

#### Tags
Each Feature may have tags. These tags also apply to any effects or damage created through the ability. For instance the Basic Pyromancy Feature grants the ability to make a special attack. The damage dealt by this attack shares all of the tags of the Feature.
Most of these tags have no effect on their own, but may be modified by other Features from yourself or others. Most commonly any Resistance from a target will apply based on the tags of your Features. The following tags are exceptions and impose special conditions on the Features to which they are attached.

**Attack:** This Feature grants you an alternative method of Attacking or modifies an existing Attack. Whenever another piece of gamer text refers to an Attack it applies both to the default Attack options and to your [Attack] Features.

**Biological:** These Features are innate to the biology of your character. As such it is rare for them to manifest through gaining Experience. You may select these Features only during character creation unless you have the Inhuman Signature Ability or explicit permission from the Dealer.

**Continuous:** You may only have a single [Continuous] Feature active at a time. If you use a second one while another is active the effect of the first immediately ends.

### Inventory
The character you play will be in part defined by the items they carry with them. Perhaps you have a family heirloom, a cursed blade, or a trusty handkerchief you carry with you. Whatever the case, the items you begin the game with and gain along your journey are as important as the Features and Attributes of your character.
While your Reserve represents all of the minutiae of life as an adventurer that would be cumbersome to track manually, your Inventory is made up of specific items which will be used either often or in moments too impactful to rely on Reserve for. Inventory is made up of two kinds of items: Equipment and Key Items.

#### Equipment
Weapons, Armor, and specialized gear worn on the body all fall under the category of Equipment. Your character has ten equipment slots and two hands by default in which to equip Equipment. Each piece of Equipment will list in its description onto which Equipment slots it must be equipped. Each equipment slot is referred to by a number and corresponds to a part of your character’s body on which the equipment is worn or carried. All of the Equipment available is listed in Appendix B.

**1 - Head**  
    Typical Equipment: Headbands, Helms, Hats, Wigs  
**2 - Face**  
    Typical Equipment: Masks, Eyewear, Makeup, Faceplates  
**3 - Neck**  
    Typical Equipment: Gorgets, Necklaces, Scarves  
**4 - Shoulders**  
    Typical Equipment: Pauldrons, Mantles  
**5 - Chest**  
    Typical Equipment: Breastplates, Shirts, Aprons  
**6 - Back**  
    Typical Equipment: Backpacks, Capes   
**7 - Wrists**  
    Typical Equipment: Bracelet, Cuffs, Bracers  
**8 - Hands**  
    Typical Equipment: Gauntlets, Gloves, Rings  
**9 - Legs**  
    Typical Equipment: Greaves, Pants, Skirts, Kilts  
**10 - Feet**  
    Typical Equipment: Boots, Sabatons, Socks  

#### Hands
The default number of hands for a character to possess is two. You may gain or lose hands as the game progresses. Hands are used to hold and wield things. Usually in combat you will be holding weapons, a shield, or keeping your hands free for the use of certain Features. Weapons, Shields, and certain Key Items will list in their descriptions how many hands are required to wield them effectively to gain their benefits. However, any of these items can be held in a single hand if necessary. You must track at all times what items you are wielding in your Hands.

#### Equipment Tags
Equipment can have tags, much like Features. These tags most often do not carry inherent meaning, but some come with specific mechanical rules attached to the piece of Equipment. Weapon tags have a variety of meanings, as listed below.

##### Weapons:
**Ammunition:** In order to make an Attack with this weapon you must expend 1 Reserve.  

**Machine:** You may not add your Might to the damage of this weapon, even if the Card you Play is within the Value range of the weapon.  

**Ranged:** This weapon cannot be used to Attack while within 1 Unit of the target. Instead, you may use it to attack any target within a number of units equal to its Range, as listed in the weapon’s description. 

**Reach:** This weapon can target a creature within 2 units of you rather than just 1.

**Two-Handed:** This weapon must be wielded in two hands in order to make an Attack with it.

**Thrown:** This weapon can be used either at Melee range or with the Range listed in its description. Using a Ranged Attack with this weapon removes it from your inventory. Weapons with this tag have two ranges listed, one for their melee reach and one for their thrown range denoted as x/y. 

**Unwieldy:** In order to Attack with this weapon you must play two Cards, using the Value of only the greater.  

#### Key Items
Any item which is notable enough to mark on your character sheet but does not fall under the category of Equipment is a Key Item. These items may be purely utilitarian in nature, or they may serve a purpose within the narrative of the game. Key Items may also be used as Equipment if they serve both functions. For instance, if you are wearing armor which has been passed down as a family heirloom it may also be counted as a Key Item. Key Items can be made via the use of certain Features such as Basic Craft. When a Key Item has an ability or use it is noted in the description of that item. Aside from the Key Items created by Features all Key Items exist at the discretion of the Dealer. The line between items represented by Reserve and items which should be noted separately can and should change based on the tone and play style of your play group.

#### Obtaining Items
Unlike most other parts of your character, you do not obtain more items purely through the mechanics of the game. Throughout your journeys you may not gain any additional items at all. Dealers may reward characters with Key Items if they so choose.

**Signature Ability:** Certain Signature Abilities will grant you pieces of equipment or a choice of pieces of equipment.

**Character Creation:** When you create your character you may spend Build as you would for Features or Attributes on Equipment. The amount you must spend on pieces of equipment is listed in the item’s description.

**Through Gameplay:** Throughout your journeys your Dealer may award you with items from quests or the chance to purchase items in shops.
